# **1. Goals and Background Context**

* **Goals**
    * To provide a centralized, real-time dashboard for production scheduling and job tracking.
    * To enable efficient drag-and-drop scheduling of jobs onto a visual calendar.
    * To offer at-a-glance KPI monitoring for key production metrics.
    * To empower department leads with natural language queries for quick data retrieval.
    * To ensure a complete audit trail for all job movements and modifications.
    * To support mobile access for on-the-floor job status updates.

* **Background Context**
    [cite_start]The PumpTracker system is designed to address the complexities of a modern manufacturing environment[cite: 1]. [cite_start]Production managers and department leads currently lack a unified, real-time view of the production schedule, leading to inefficiencies, delays, and difficulty in tracking job progress[cite: 1]. [cite_start]This PRD outlines a comprehensive solution that combines a Kanban-style interface, a drag-and-drop calendar, and a powerful AI-driven query engine to provide clarity, control, and actionable insights into the entire production workflow[cite: 1].
