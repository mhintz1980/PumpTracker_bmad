Title: Project Initialization & Firebase Setup
---

### Story

As a developer, I want to set up a new Next.js 15 project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, so that I have a clean foundation to build the application on.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new Next.js 15 project is created using the App Router.
2.  TypeScript and Tailwind CSS are correctly configured.
3.  A new Firebase project is created.
4.  Firebase SDK is integrated into the Next.js application, with separate configurations for client and server.
5.  The project is connected to a local Git repository with an initial commit.

### Dev Notes

**Tech Stack:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

*   Frontend Language: TypeScript 5.x
*   Frontend Framework: Next.js 15.x
*   Styling: Tailwind CSS
*   Database: Firebase Firestore v9+
*   Authentication: Firebase Auth v9+

**Project Structure:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

*   The project should follow the unified project structure defined in the architecture.
*   Firebase configuration should be located in `src/lib/firebase/`.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Implement Firebase Security Rules to control data access.
*   Handle API keys and sensitive information using environment variables (e.g., `.env.local` for Next.js) and ensure they are not committed to version control.
*   Design authentication flows with Firebase Authentication, considering user session management and token handling.

**Testing:**

*   Unit tests should be created for any new components or utility functions. Consider using Jest and React Testing Library.
*   Run linting (e.g., ESLint) and formatting (e.g., Prettier) checks to ensure code quality.
