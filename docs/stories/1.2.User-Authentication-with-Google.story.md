Title: User Authentication with Google
---

### Story

As an Admin, I want to log in to the application using my Google credentials, so that I can access the system securely.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  Firebase Authentication with the Google Provider is enabled.
2.  A "Login with Google" button is present on the login page.
3.  Clicking the button initiates the Google OAuth flow.
4.  Upon successful authentication, a user record is created in Firebase Auth.
5.  A corresponding user document is created in a `users` collection in Firestore, storing their UID, email, and a default role of "Department Lead".
6.  The user is redirected to the main dashboard page after login.
7.  A logout mechanism is available.

### Dev Notes

**Tech Stack:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

*   Authentication: Firebase Auth v9+
*   Database: Firebase Firestore v9+

**Project Structure:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

*   Auth routes will be located in `src/app/(auth)/`.
*   The login page will be at `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`.
*   Firebase configuration is located in `src/lib/firebase/`.
*   Server Actions will be in `src/lib/actions/`.
*   Shared types are in `src/lib/types/`.
*   Middleware for authentication and RBAC is at `src/middleware.ts`.

**Data Models:** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

*   A `users` collection will be used to store user profiles:
    ```typescript
    interface UserProfile {
      uid: string;   // Auth UID = Doc ID
      email: string;
      role: 'Admin' | 'Department Lead';
      displayName?: string;
      avatarUrl?: string;
    }
    ```

**Authentication Flow:** [Source: architecture/security-authentication.md]

1.  Unauthenticated visit triggers middleware redirect to `/login`.
2.  User selects “Login with Google”.
3.  Firebase Auth handles OAuth popup/redirect.
4.  On success the client receives a JWT; SDK auto-refreshes tokens.
5.  A matching `users` document is created if absent.
6.  The client attaches the ID token with each Server Action invocation.

**Testing**

*   Unit tests should be created for all new Server Actions.
*   Test files should be located alongside the code they are testing, with a `.test.ts` extension.
*   Integration tests should be written to verify the entire authentication flow, from login to logout.
*   E2E tests should be created to simulate user interaction with the login page and dashboard.

### Tasks / Subtasks

*   [x] **Task 1: Configure Firebase Authentication (AC: #1)**
    *   [ ] Enable the Google Authentication provider in the Firebase console.
*   [x] **Task 2: Create Login Page (AC: #2)**
    *   [x] Create a new route at `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`.
    *   [x] Add a "Login with Google" button.
*   [x] **Task 3: Implement Google Sign-In (AC: #3, #4)**
    *   [x] Create a Server Action to handle the Google sign-in process.
    *   [x] Use the Firebase Admin SDK to verify the ID token.
    *   [x] On successful verification, create a user record in Firebase Auth.
*   [x] **Task 4: Create User Profile in Firestore (AC: #5)**
    *   [x] After user creation in Auth, create a corresponding document in the `users` collection in Firestore.
    *   [x] The user document should store the UID, email, and a default role of "Department Lead".
*   [x] **Task 5: Implement Logout (AC: #7)**
    *   [x] Create a Server Action to handle user logout.
    *   [x] Add a logout button to the main dashboard page.
*   [x] **Task 6: Implement Middleware (AC: #6)**
    *   [x] Create a `middleware.ts` file.
    *   [x] The middleware should protect the `/dashboard` route and redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`.
