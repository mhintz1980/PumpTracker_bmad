the baic idea of my Pump Tracker app is as follows:

kanban card drag and drop scheduling and tracking of jobs. The dashboard page which, through collapsible side bars/mini windows that dynamically expand, dockable modals and/or other yet to be determined methods, allows for quick and easy access to the entirety of the app.  It will include drag and drop scheduling and production tracking as well as a section for charts, graphs and other metrics that dynamically update to reflect overall shop status, Customer specific orders and even model ad department specific status based on user selection. Every movement of the job card, whether by drag and drop, new job/PO creation, etc. is documented in a database with persistant memory.  The individual job cards have their own detailed data attached such as Model, Build Time, Customer, PO, Paint Color, Priority, Serial Number, etc. that gets paired with every trigger event from that cards' movements like start date, completion of stages of production, back and forth trips to Powder Coaters, completion of Assembly and Testing departments, the whole way to the job shipping to the customer is recorded.  This data is able to be queried by a built in agentic AI that is able to answer all of the users questions.  These questions can be simple:

"How many of 'Model B' are on order?"

To much more detailed and nuanced questions:

"When are all of the 'Model A' for 'Customer B' scheduled to be back from our Powder Coating vendor?" or "If we make nothing but 'Model C' how long will it take to fill 'Customer B' open PO?".

Multiple team members, who log in with google credentials (maybe other options), can use the app on their mobile device to update progress of jobs.  For example, Employee #1 picks up 2 jobs from Powder Coating Vendor #2 and can drag and drop the  related two job cards to their next departments.  The agentic AI can do things on request (or as pre-scheduled tasks) such as emailing a vendor when the a job is getting ready to be dropped off and supply any necessary details.  It could also alert managers when new jobs come in that could potentially change their production plan.  The AI can also generate static or interactive charts, graphs, and other visual aids to help explain certain answers to queries where images can be advantageous, such as Pie charts showing which customers comprise the most orders or bar graphs comparing revenue across different times., (revenue is calculated the set price of the specific jobs.  Model A  is alway $15,000 and Model B is always #$32,000, etc).
